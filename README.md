# Severino

>Needs discord.js


Severino’s a `discord.js` based bot which usage is:

- receive a `!bot TOKEN` message
- if `TOKEN` matches with a custom token previously generated, user who said it will be granted a specific role.

---- 

## Token?

For now, `TOKEN` can only be set previously and every single `TOKEN` can be used infinite times.

I personally recommend a very-very-hard password, like the ones generated by [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com) or [Strong Password Generator](https://www.strongpasswordgenerator.com) for admin-only roles.

----

## Do you even *caracrachá*?

Severino also shows a "game" status if your server's game-related, which can be set on [severino.js](/severino.js) `line 7`.

------

## Developed by

Please let the following message on the `!bot info` command.

```js
client.on('message', function(message){

  if(message.content == '!bot info')
  {
    return message.reply("`BOT NAME HERE`'s a **`discord.js`** open-source bot based on `Severino` by `github.com/gabrguedes`."
    )
  }
});	
```

## Usage:

```bash
$ node severino.js
```
